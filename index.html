 <h3> Background and release</h3>
 <p/> The album's lead single, "I Need U", was first previewed in December 2022 and released on February 14, 2023, coinciding with Valentine's Day. On June 2, Carson officially announced the project's title and an initial release date of July 17. The album's tracklist was shared on June 25, revealing that it would consist of 14 tracks and feature multiple guest artists. A second single, "It's Over", was teased but never released, and the album ultimately missed its original release date for reasons outside of Ken Carson's control. Carson tweeted a pre-save link for the album on October 6, indicating that the project would now be released on the 13th of that same month, the day of which was a Friday the 13th. The post included a finalized track listing of 18 songs; three days later, nearly the entire album leaked online after several tracks were shared on a Discord server which almost delayed it , but luckily the plan to drop went through.
